# Docs site, roadmap, and timeout fixes

*2026-02-13*

Removed hard-coded timeouts (60s playback, 120s recording) from the MCP server that were killing conversations mid-flow. Restructured the docs site into `guide/` and `roadmap/` folders with navigation tabs. Added hardware requirements, version history (v0.0.1 through v0.3.0), and a planned features list with checkboxes. Investigated VoiceMode — it's just an installer, standalone scripts are on the roadmap. Added MIT license, README, and tagged v0.2.0.
