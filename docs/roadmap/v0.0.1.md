# v0.0.1

Initial release — standalone FastAPI server using the Claude API directly.

## Features

- [x] **Claude API integration** — Used the Anthropic Python SDK (`anthropic.Anthropic()`) to call Claude Sonnet 4.5 directly. Each message was a new API call with conversation history passed in.
- [x] **FastAPI REST endpoints** — Browser communicated via HTTP POST to `/api/transcribe`, `/api/chat`, and `/api/speak`.
- [x] **Browser client** — Hold-to-talk mic button, audio playback, conversation managed client-side in JavaScript.
- [x] **Whisper STT + Kokoro TTS** — GPU-accelerated speech services on localhost.

## Limitations

- **API costs** — Every message was a direct Claude API call, adding up quickly.
- **No tool access** — Claude could only chat, not use tools or access the filesystem.

## Superseded Architecture

After v0.0.1, an intermediate approach using `claude -p` (Claude Code CLI pipe mode) was tried but never committed. Each invocation loaded all skills and MCP servers from scratch, making it extremely slow. This was abandoned in favor of the persistent MCP server in v0.1.0.
