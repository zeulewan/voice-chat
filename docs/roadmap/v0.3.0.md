# v0.3.0

Reliability and structural improvements.

## Features

- [ ] **Auto-launch Claude Code** — A button in the browser UI that spawns a Claude Code session on the server and runs `/voice-chat` automatically, so users never need to open a terminal.
- [ ] **Session ID display** — Show the Claude Code session ID in the browser UI so conversations can be resumed later with `claude --resume`.
- [x] **No recording timeout** — Remove the 120-second timeout on voice recording.
- [ ] **WebSocket stability** — Fix `Unexpected ASGI message 'websocket.send'` errors that cause audio drops mid-conversation. Investigate race conditions between playback, recording, and connection lifecycle.
- [ ] **Native macOS/iOS app** — Swift app that mirrors the browser client functionality — WebSocket connection, audio playback, microphone recording, and conversation display.
