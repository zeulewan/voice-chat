# v0.3.0

Quick wins — reliability fixes and simple UI improvements.

## Reliability

- [x] **No recording timeout** — Remove the 120-second timeout on voice recording.
- [ ] **WebSocket stability** — Fix `Unexpected ASGI message 'websocket.send'` errors that cause audio drops mid-conversation.
- [ ] **Interrupt support** — Tap the mic button during audio playback to stop it immediately and start speaking.
- [ ] **Auto-reconnect with state recovery** — Browser auto-reconnects on WebSocket drop. May already work — needs verification.

## Browser UI

- [ ] **Chat transcript** — Display full text of user and assistant messages in a scrollable chat view.
- [ ] **Mute button** — Toggle to mute TTS playback so Claude works silently.
- [ ] **Bigger mic button** — Increase mic button size for easier tap targets.
- [ ] **Audio feedback cues** — Short sounds for state transitions: thinking, ready to listen, response buffered.
- [ ] **Auto-start recording** — When Claude finishes speaking, the browser should automatically enter recording mode without requiring the user to tap the mic button or focus the tab. Currently the `listening` signal from the server triggers recording, but the browser may not respond if the tab is in the background.
