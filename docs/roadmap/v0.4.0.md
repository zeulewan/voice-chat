# v0.4.0

Advanced features — deeper integrations and native app.

## Audio & Voice

- [ ] **Voice activity detection** — Auto-detect when the user stops speaking and end recording. Include a toggle to disable in noisy environments.
- [ ] **Streaming TTS** — Stream audio chunks as Kokoro generates them to reduce time-to-first-audio.
- [ ] **Mid-task interjection** — Allow the user to speak while Claude is working, queuing audio for context.

## Browser UI

- [ ] **Auto-launch Claude Code** — Button that spawns a Claude Code session and runs `/voice-chat` automatically.
- [ ] **Session ID display** — Show Claude Code session ID for resuming conversations with `claude --resume`.
- [ ] **Conversation history** — Persist chat history across page refreshes using localStorage. Allow Claude to read the history on session start.

## Native App

- [ ] **macOS/iOS app** — Swift app mirroring the browser client: WebSocket, audio playback, recording, conversation display.
